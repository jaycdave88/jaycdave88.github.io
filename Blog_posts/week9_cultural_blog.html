				<p>In this blog I will be reviewing some of my pervious questions that I have asked to the community, and how affective I was at conveying my question.</p><br>

<p>In my pursuit in answering, &#34;how do I ask a good question?&#34; some material I found gave me some great pointers that needless to say should always be executed when ever trying to convey a question, whether online or not.</p><br>

<i><font size="2.5"><ul>
<li>Spelling, grammar and punctuation </li>
<li>Sum up your entire question into one sentence</li>
<li>Try writing the title for your question last</li>
<li>Proof-read before posting</li>
<li>Respond to feedback</li>
</ul></i></font><br>


<p>Some questions that I have asked previously in the community were:</p><br>
<div class="img">
<i><font size="2.5"><p>&#34;Hey guys!</p><br>

<p>I am new to making sites and wanted to know how to have my site work on iPads and smart phones? My drop down menu does not work on them.</p><br>

<p>Thanks in advance !!&#34;</p></font></i>
</div><br>

<p>After doing some research on asking &#34;how to ask effective questions&#34;, I would say that this question is good but not great. It touches on some of the criteria for asking a good question. However I believe it can be improved upon with some more details and better formatting. </p><br>

<div class="img">
<i><font size="2.5"<p>&#34;Hey guys,</p><br>

<p>So I am working on week 8, Javascript (grade book) and on release 7.</p>

<p>I am having an issue, I defined a function "average" outside the scope of my "gradebook" object.</p> 

<p>I am trying to pass "average" into "getAverage", but am getting an error.</p>

<p>Is this not global scope? I thought I could just pass it in...</p><br>

<p>Thanks in advance&#34;</p></font></i>

<p>I had asked this question to my Google plus community, while having an issue with JavaScript. After my research I found that this question was not a good question at all for different reasons. It could have been better formatted also I included a pic of my code, which is not proper practice. Imagine if you are working at a big company and you have a question about there code and you post questions about the code with a screen shot of the code. This could lead to some serious repercussions.</p><br>

<p>Just remember &#34;The Golden Rule&#34;. After you finish your question and you have checked it and double-checked it try to approach your question as if someone else would be. Can you answer your own question with the given information? If you answer yes, go ahead and post it if not... then try a different approach.</p>
