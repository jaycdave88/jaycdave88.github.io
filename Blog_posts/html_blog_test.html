<p>COOL – it’s a catchall for everything from a state of mind to sweater weather. And while it’s one of those words that’s always on tongue tips, it can be harder to hone in on a single definition.</p>

<p>But one thing is certain: from now until August 17, STORY is all about COOL – from how it looks and tastes to what it feels like. We’ve teamed up with Quirky and GE to put a coolly inventive spin on things. They’ll be introducing us to a Aros, a smart new air conditioner that tracks users’ habits and budget, to automatically maintain the perfect at-home temperature.</p>

<p>Equally COOL: we’ll be highlighting some of the coolest stuff we’ve stumbled upon lately – from JIX, a connectable system for building sculptures of straws and Grady’s Cold Brew (we’ve got it on tap!) a Brooklyn-based iced-coffee concentrate to Hay Rosie, a new craft ice cream upstart that’s got our brains on freeze. There will be COOL stuff to discover from more than 5 brands we met at Pitch Night and COOL stuff to do thanks to some awesomely #RandomActsofQuirky, all set in a super COOL space, built with the support of our friends at Home Depot.</p><p>COOL – it’s a catchall for everything from a state of mind to sweater weather.
