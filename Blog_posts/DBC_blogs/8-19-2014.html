                <p>Life always gives you some ups and downs, but they always make you stronger are more humble for being alive.</p> 
                <br>

                <p>Tuesday was something else compared to some of the other days here at DBC, first off we started our day with our morning lecture just like any other day. Today we dove into active record, really got into the meat and potatoes of itâ€¦ we got to play around with active directory jr, which is basically active directory but without all the full functionality that active directory has. We covered some topics of Object Relational Mapping and just a crash course of what active directory is and where to find the documentation on it online to help if we get stuck,( which was super helpful).</p> 
                <br>

                <p>After we had started that and worked on that for a while we broke up into teams and started to work on the challenges, today I paired up with Alisa. Alisa and I haven&#39;t paired together since phase 0 and it was really fun! She brings her personality to the pair, which makes everything so much easier to deal with especially when you have frustrations of learning something new.  We worked through the active directory jr, challenges which were pretty straight forward and of course active directory in general is pretty interesting and easy to find docs on it, which makes it super easy. I really enjoy doing database queries and accessing databases didn&#39;t know that about myself till we did this challenge.</p> 
                <br>

                <p>Later in the day after lunch and yoga we had our last EE session (emotional empathy) class, the topic was about our feelings and we all sat in a circle and shared one bit of our past that we wanted to share. It was very intense, but with anything here at DBC they help you grow by having you step out of your comfort zones and really give you the stage to put on your own best Broadway play.</p>
