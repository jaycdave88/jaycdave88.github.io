                <p>&#34;Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.&#34; - Thomas A. Edison</p>
                <br>

                <p>This is the quote what I read this morning and stuck in my head all day. Today was a very eventful Monday morning! It was the start of week 3 of Phase 1.  Looks like phase 1 is almost over and soon we are moving on to Phase 2! The really great thing about DBC is that they allow you to repeat each Phase, one time (except for Phase 3), I have been thinking a lot about repeating Phase 1, its not that I didn&#39;t learn all the concepts and everything or didn&#39;t try, I just think of it as another 3 weeks, that could benefit me solidify some of concepts with OO and Active Directory. I just keep telling myself that this is not a race, and that the only person I am competing against is myself.  Luckily, we had our mock assessments and I preformed very well, according to my instructors. I think before I have any conversation about repeating Phase 1 I will wait till our Phase 1 official assessment and only repeat if the instructors recommend it.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Other that some of the things that have been going through my head all day, lets talk about what happen today. Today was a very difficult day, I say difficult but that means just challenging. We started today just like any other Monday, with our morning lectures, todays topic was the introduction of Schema and working with SQlite with parallel of Ruby.  We went over how to use access data from a database from Ruby; we also hit on some recaps of what MVC was, with some Meta patterns and the processes of how to implement access to Ruby.</p>
                <br>

                <p>We had a few challenge of using SQlite and writing some code in Ruby that would allow us to CRUD (Create, read, update, delete), a database. I worked with Ryan today and as always we worked well together, I learn a lot from working with him and I enjoy seeing how he debugs errors in his code. SQlite is just a pain in the butt with all its little syntax and everything, a task that would normally take me 30 minutes took me longer, having to go back and debug all my code for syntax errors.</p> 
                <br>

                <p>Today was a difficult day and I think a very tedious day, but even thou it wasn&#39;t my favorite day it went well, because I can say I walked away learning more that I knew yesterday.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Tomorrow is going to be a very interesting day as well will be the first day that I get to mess around with some active directory! Just got to keep strong and make sure that I don&#39;t doubt my abilities and make sure that I give each day 100%</p>
