                <p>Happy Thursday everyone!! Hope everyone is having a great day! I really liked today I felt like it was very easy compared to some of the other days we have had here at DBC.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Right from the get go, all of DBC cohorts from Phase1 to Phase3 met up for a final project pitch for Phase3. This was really exciting to see what we would be working on later down the road! Also seeing all of the creative ideas that all the Phase 3 guys was just really inspiring.</p>
                <br>

                <p>After that we had our morning lecture that was about Database Design and just really a refresher of SQL and just to think of SQL like a excel sheet of info that holds your information. We also covered some different types of scheme designs from one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many, it was nice to have a refresher in all of this! It really helped me remember some of my SQL stuff from phase 0.</p>
                <br>

                <p>After our lecture we paired up with a new person from our accountability group. Today I paired with Gary; we had worked together just once before in phase0 he was in my first group accountability group. I think we paired really well together, today didn&#39;t even feel like work! It was just fun! We worked through our challenge and played off each other really well, if one of use got stuck doing something the other jumped in and helped work through the problem right away!</p>
                <br>

                <p>Also today was our personal mock assessments, I am not going to lie I was super stressed about it... till I my turn came up and I sat down and worked on the code. Sharif was our instructor and we just have to live code certain tasks in front of him. Everything was really easy for me, I worked through the problems and then after about 25 minutes he called it. I asked him what kind of feedback did he have to give me, he said I did everything really well, that I was writing test with what I wanted to print out and also I was testing as I was writing and if I ran into a bug I would read the bug then go back and fix my error. Sharif also mentioned that since I was cracking jokes and laughing during my assessment it showed him that I was having fun, and that would just keep my learning curve up. So to sum it all up... It went great!</p>
                <br>

                <p>Towards the end of the day before I was about to leave and head to the bar to grab a beer with some other classmates, I was heading to the bathroom and saw Davin, a fellow classmate who looked kind of bummed out. I asked him what was going on, he expressed to me that his coach had cancelled his session with him and that he didn&#39;t do so well on his assessment. I started to talk to him a bit more to get some more information from him, like what areas did he feel that he was having the most issues, after a quick 5 minutes I could tell he just felt like he was &#34;under-water&#34;, so I offered to help him with some things that I saw he was having trouble with. I sat down with him and asked him to read and explain what was going on in this Ruby file, that I had on my local hard drive. He was going through it but I saw he was getting very frustrated so I went in a different direction, and asked him to show me how to add names to an array, by doing this I was getting him conformable with data structure and also his nervousness. After that we went ahead and worked on iterating over a data structure and how to manipulate data and the difference between some loops, also the difference between &#34;p&#34;, &#34;puts&#34;, &#34;print&#34;. After we finished up he said that I really helped him understand some of the stuff he needed to work on. I also showed him some good resources for addition practice to help him if he wanted to work on it at home.</p>
