				<p>Whoa, its already Wednesday?!? Where did the week go? Well we lets see today was a very interesting day, and by interesting was it started a little shaky but came together towards the end of the day!</p>
				<br>

				<p>Today we had our usual 9:00am lecture, but todays topic was on MVC Tools and Approach, instructed by Brick. This lecture was good, I feel like it helped me understand maybe just a little bit more of what the hell I was doing, haha. It was good change from the usual lectures. We went over CSV files (Comma Separated Values) how to use them within a Ruby file. Went over how to parse through the data, and made a mock file and did some cool stuff and showed how a Hash would be great for a Data Type if you wanted to manipulate the data.</p>
				<br>

				<p>I found the ARGV very interesting. I remember seeing a little bit of it, when reading over some of the code from the weeks coming up to DBC&#39;s big interview, haha. I had come across &#34;Learn Ruby The Hard Way&#34;. That was a great book that I found all on my own, and then after having my interview with Gary, he mentioned to check out that book out. Anyways, ARGV haha… putting ARGV is basically letting you run Ruby without out anything being prompt to the user, (gets.chomp). The reason I really like this was that the first time I saw this I didn’t know what the hell it was! But now I know what it is and how to takes anything that is passed into when you run your code. It will take everything and make it an array of strings ([&#34;I&#34;,&#34;Love&#34;,&#34;Peanut&#34;,&#34;Butter&#34;]).  We also dove a bit more into the &#34;__FILE__&#34; and how it returns everything as a string rather then a String of Arrays.  And that will show your current location of the file, and &#34;$0&#34; will show the working directory or 2nd file that you may be requiring.</p>
				<br>

				<p>After our lecture we had the change to dive into todays challenge. This was by far my favorite challenge thus far! It was very hard, I paired with Melissa today I felt like our pair went very well! We worked great together and really made sure the other one was giving the best they could which was great! I felt motivated to do better from seeing how much she was giving! It felt great and refreshing to do that! I feel like we are both still new to OO, but I have to say the feeling when we had everything running when we were finished was freaking amazing! I haven&#39;t had that feeling since I finished my blog!</p> 
				<br>

				<p>The Challenge itself was much better in my opinion then the Ruby Racer; this showed a better understanding of the real practical usages for a code like this. Rather then Ruby Racer that was just meant to release endorphins in your body from watching something move across the screen. We had to design a application that would take a input via terminal and return your command. Getting information and removing data from a CSV file, we had to do a ToDo list. This challenge took Melissa and I the rest of the day. Although we took our time on this challenge I think we really got a great understanding of what we were doing.</p>
				<br>  

				<p>The second lecture we had was just way to confusing to understand or take notes on, so I used that time too just focus on reading the code as he wrote it. I am sure you will see a blog later on about me having to use this later on.</p>
