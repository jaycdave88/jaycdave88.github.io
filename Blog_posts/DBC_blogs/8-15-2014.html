                <p>Happy Friday everyone! Hope everyone has a great day! As each day goes by here at DBC I cant but help thinking of what I have learned so far and what I am able to create and that I am only going to keep getting better, that for me is super exciting. I just keep telling myself the 1000-hour rule, which it’s going to take 1000 hours to become good at something. I would say great or amazing but if I say that then you will never continue to grow.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Every Friday we all meet up in our weekly check-ins with all the other cohorts. I think that’s a great way to see what is really going on in other phases see what is bothering them and what to expect when we get to that level. Also getting all the different people to mingle together gives you a sense of the DBC community that is just really amazing!</p> 
                <br>

                <p>After our check-ins we all met up for our morning lecture. Today was the first day that we had our group projects and we were introduced to contracts. By the way a contract is just another way of saying, “I will work on this and you guys work on that”. Nothing major, anyways… we were talking about our data structure and how to build the application for todays challenge, the flash cards. The challenge its self was really great! I really enjoyed working on the flashcard game and how to implement different things that we learned. We worked with parsing a different file, we worked with CSV files before… this time we worked with just another kind of flat file, just a plain .txt file with new lines.</p>
                <br>

                <p>For this challenge we didn’t just have to work on a new kind of file but we also had to work in groups, which is always interesting to see how everyone different personalities melt together and how everyone works together. Lucky, I worked with Danny, Andrew, and Matt today. I think we all worked really well together and had a very strong group dynamic, for our contracts that I had mentioned before… Andrew and Danny worked on the logic of the flashcard app where Matt and myself worked on parsing over the file, some design elements, and returning the data in a specific format to run with the way they were implementing the code.</p> 
                <br>


                <p>We made our code run! It worked out great and it was great to finally get a change to work with Danny since phase 0. Not going to lie the code did take some time to get running but we all stuck through it and made it work, but most importantly we learned a lot along the way!</p>
