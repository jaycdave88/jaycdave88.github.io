		<p>JavaScript is slowly taking over! Dont be alarmed its for the best! JavaScript or JS for short, which I will be calling it from this point on. JS is very popular in web development, JS works on all devices and in all browsers, (i.e. Chrome, Safari, FireFox, etc.) which pretty much guaranteeing that your HTML page will always render. Also since so many people out there already are using JS it makes information and education material readily available, also JS tools and frameworks seem to be everywhere now a day.</p>
	

		
			<p>JavaScript is great in many aspects but one of the most noticeable ones are that its a &#34;scripting language&#34; (Scripting Language is a programming language that supports scripts, programs written for a special run-time environment that can interpret (rather than compile) and automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.) So... what does that mean?! Well ... normal code is done with some steps:</p>
	
			<br>
			<b><i><p>1.Writting- you write the code</p></i></b>
		
		
			<b><i><p>2.Compiling- takes the code you wrote and then the computer reads that and sees what you want it to do.</p></i></b>
	
		
			<b><i><p>3.Executing- Where all your hard work comes together.</p></i></b>
		
			<br>
			<p>Back to JavaScript, what makes it better?! You can deliver code to any page using the <"script"> tag... once that is done the browser downloads the code with the page and begins interpreting it! No complication needed!!</p>

		
			<p>So I guess your thinking JavaScript is pretty amazing! It can do it all!!... well it cant.There are a few things that JS can not do:</p>
			<br>
	
			<b><i><p>1. JavaScript cannot write to files on the server without the help of a server side script</p></i></b>
			
		
			<b><i><p>2. JavaScript cannot access databases</p></i></b>
			
			<b><i><p>3. JavaScript cannot read from or write to files in the client</p></i></b>
			
			<b><i><p>4. JavaScript cannot close a window if it didnt open it</p></i></b>
			
			<b><i><p>5. JavaScript cannot access web pages hosted on another domain.</p></i></b>
			
			<b><i><p>6. JavaScript cannot protect your source or images</p></i></b>
