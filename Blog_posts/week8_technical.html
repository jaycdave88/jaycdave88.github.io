		<p>The Internet is a global system of interconnected computers networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide.
		That is the definition that Wikipedia gives, but what does that really mean??</p>

		<p>In next following paragraphs I will be explaining how to Internet works in the most layman&#39;s terms I could think of.</p>

		<p>The Internet is a wire that is buried underground; it can be copper or fiber optic or occasionally beamed to satellite or even (what most of us do) through cellphone networks. (See figure 1)</p>

		<p>The Internet is useful because two computers directly connected to the Internet can communicate. A Server is a special computer that is directly connected to the Internet. (See figure 2) The Webpages that everyone goes too are files on those Servers hard drives. (See figure 3)</p>

		</div>

		<p>Every server has a unique Internet protocol address (IP), just like a postal address. IP address help computers find each other. Since IP addresses are all numbers (72.14.205.100)... let&#39;s face it that is not really easy to remember...this is why we give them names like Google.com. (See figure 4)</p>

		</div>

		 <p>Your home computer is <b>not</b> a server, because it is not connected directly to the Internet. Computer that you and I use are called &#34;<i>Clients</i> &#34; because they are indirectly connected to the Internet via a ISP (Internet Service Provider). (See figure 5)</p>

		<p>Lets say you are working next to your boss and they are looking up on Marketing Research and you are on Facebook. You both are sending packets across the Internet, but what stops your boss from getting your packets instead? The solution to that problem is IP address and Routers; everything connected to the Internet has an IP address...everything! This includes your computer, servers, cellphones, and all other equipment in between. (See figure 6)</p>

		<div class="img">

		</div>

		<p>Anywhere two or more parts of the Internet intersect there is a piece of equipment called a Router. Routers direct your packet around the Internet helping each packet get one step closer to its destination. When ever you visit a website there are upwards of 10 -15 may help your packet to and from your computer. (See figure 7)</p>
		<div class="img">

		</div>

		<p>Each IP address is directly addressable, so any router can direct your packet to any other part of the Internet. </p>
