				<p>My personal thinking style would have to be a majority of half Abstract Sequential (AS), and the other 75 percent Abstract Random (AR) with a few characteristics of about 25 percent Concrete Sequential (CS).</p>
				<br>
		
			<p>DBC can help me with my learning style since, I learn best when I have access to experts or references and also when I am placed into a stimulating environment. I also enjoy my point to be heard and I feel that DBC would allow me to have my own voice, and I would apply my logic to solve or find solutions to the problems that are in front of me.</p> 
			<br>
	
			<p>Since I am also a Abstract Random (AR) I do also feel that DBC will aid in an environment where it is very personalized and personable, but also allowing the instructions or guidelines to be broad so I can interpreted as I see fit. Having a smaller class size will also aid me in being able to participate in group activates, since I also am a personable I also like to establish healthy relationships with others by listen to them and bringing my own harmony to group situations.</p>
			<br>
		
			<p>Since beginning of Phase 0, my biggest struggle would have to be just learning everything that I am doing and retaining that information and making sure that I can use it for a later time.  I feel as if it is related to the way I think, I learn best when I am in groups, or when I am surrounded in a stimulated learning environment with the aid of professionals or experts that can help me with my issues.</p>
			<br>
		
			<p>I feel that now knowing more about myself and my learning styles I can make some more changes to the way that I handle everything. Changing my environment and doing more peer pairing so that I can learn from others and use my group skills to really help me out.</p>
