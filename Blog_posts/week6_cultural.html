<p>When you conduct a Google search on &#34;stereotype threat&#34;, you get the following definition: stereotype threat is the experience of anxiety or concern in a situation where a person has the potential to confirm a negative stereotype about their social group.</p>
			<p>I remember when I was in high school and one of my good friends were African American, and how he was one of the smartest people I knew. He would know all the material and study but when it came down to test he would fail. I just thought he was not a good test taker, having a good friend who wasn&#39;t doing well in school did effect me; I wanted to help him and see what was wrong. Eventually over time he gave up trying and his interests were else where, and we slowly stopped talking. </p>

			<p>I think that Stereotype Threat can play a major part on someone&#39;s life. We as people are very social creatures, and we do care what people think of us as much as some may say they do not, the sense of community and belonging is always there. If people of a certain race, age, social background, etc. Has a pre existing notion of whatever false perception of them, which can really hinder someone personal success. If I was presented with Stereotype Threat and it was directed towards myself, my plan would just be to ignore that notion and prove who ever wrong, but that is my personality I don&#39;t back down from anything. If I noticed someone else who was being presented with Stereotype Threat I think I would go up to them and give them some reassurance, some kind words, and tell them what I think they are doing is great and what they are doing is well, I guess my approach would be to kill it with kindness.</p>

			<p>Whenever I give feedback to anyone I try to make it very specific and very kind, by giving them examples of what they did that was good and giving them areas in which they could use some improvement. Now knowing what I do now about Stereotype Threat I can safely say that I will be more diligent with making sure that I do offer the best feedback and for myself not to hold any one person to any certain stereotype.</p>

			<p>In a perfect world, everyone who comes into contact with another person different them themselves would not have any prior notion about them.  I say perfect but not unreachable,  I can not speak for everyone, but for myself I know that I will be making a change by keeping an open mind, and being more sensitive towards other peoples feelings.</p>
