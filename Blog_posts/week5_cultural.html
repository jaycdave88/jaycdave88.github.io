				<p>One of the best things that I like about the development community is the collaboration, and how you may know one way of doing something...but here comes &#34;John Smith&#34; and shows you a complete different way of doing things! Which benefits you technically, where you have your &#34;aha&#34; moment.</p>
				<br>

<p>I try to pair program with as many people as I can, I will even go over challenges or problems that I have already finished, just to see if there is a better way for solving the problem! To me I look at programing like a giant puzzle, and you need to solve the problem, but as where a typical puzzle only has one solution. Programming has many solutions that make it so exciting! I can recall one peer pair I had with a fellow class mate where we were just both absolutely stuck and were not progressing anymore. This is usually the point where the frustration kicks in, so we decided to call it and take a beak we came back to it after an hour and started to attack it again and we solved it! That was one of the best experiences so far I have had with peer pairing!</p>
<br>

<p>When you have a code that works out just how you wanted that can turn anyone&#39;s day from bad to great! There are also the special kinds of days where your code just doesn&#39;t like you at all. I have been fortunate to have a few of those days more often then less, why do I say fortunate? Well its simple...I learned from it. I enjoy learning and growing, as should everyone! That&#39;s why being challenged and working through my frustration helped me grow and I learned.</p>
<br>

<p>One thing that I love for the good or the bad is receiving feedback from others. Lets be honest, at times we all think we are doing everything perfect, later to find out that what you though was right or kind or actionable was actually the complete opposite. By having feedback you can go and see what was not working and work on it, to make yourself better! It sounds simple but for some it&#39;s the hardest thing to hear that you didn&#39;t do this or this.</p>
<br>

<p>Whenever I receive feedback from my peer pairing programming sessions, I take note of it for and work on things to make myself better and more efficient at what I am trying to accomplish. For example my past feedback from a fellow classmate was along the lines of &#34;try not to do both roles, let the other person play&#34;. That feedback was very helpful to me! It showed me that I need to take a step back sometimes and not try to get too ahead of myself.</p> 
<br>

<p>Just like receiving feedback it is also very important to write good actionable feedback. Whenever I give feedback I always like to make things a little more personal then just, &#34;lets get this over with&#34;. Making it fun for both people and not so stressful is a good way for everyone to learn. When I write feedback for others I really enjoy it, I am indirectly helping them grow into a better programmer! I only say indirectly because I can only say it, its here job to take the input and make changes.</p>
<br>

<p>Lets sum it all up!! My opinion on feedback and its role on how to guide your learning... I 100% agree with it! Not only does it  help with communication skills but also provides you a voice where you can say what you liked and what you didnt.</p>
