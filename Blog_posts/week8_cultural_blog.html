			<p>This week I have blogged about emotional conflict. Wikipedia defines Emotional Conflict as the presence of different and opposing emotions relating to a situation that has recently taken place or is in the process of being unfolded.</p>

<p>On my search for a professional career, I happen to stumble across an opportunity in outside sales. Whenever you have so many well-motivated individuals, there are bound to be some conflict, and this was no different. Early on while I was still building my sales leads, I had come across an area that was still Green &#34;T&#34;. Some of my other co-workers were struggling in there particular area because of high saturation rate. I was able to rehash a lot of new leads from existing customers and customers that I had helped set up.</p> 

<p>While hard working and egger individuals surrounded me there was a time where I did have a conflict with another co-worker. I was working over the holiday weekend (by choice), and they were upset and felt that I was doing a dishonest thing by working during the weekend. I did not see anything wrong with putting in more hours, the following week I headed out to my area to continue my rehash. Only to find out that someone has already come by from my office and helped the customer out, at first I thought nothing of it... till a few other potential customers were not willing to meet with me because &#34;someone had already stopped by&#34;.</p>

<p>I felt angry and frustrated, I then confronted the individual who was stealing my leads and had exchanged some words. After talking to them and hearing their reason behind their actions, I was no longer angry. They had done that because they were very behind on some bills at home, after hearing their problem I offered to take them out on a day where we would work together and I would give some feedback on what I think they need to work on.</p>

<p>After taking the time out to hear out my co-worker&#39;s issues, and offering a solution to taking him out and seeing what all could be done to help them out the turnout the following week was great! Not only did he manage to catch up on his bills at home but also out preformed many people in the office including myself.</p>

<p>If I had the option to go back I would only change one thing. That one thing would be not to be so quick to judge someone for their actions, you never know what they have going on in their life. I also learned that even if you are in a highly competitive and stressful environment like sales, there is nothing wrong with helping other people out and leading a hand wherever you can.</p>
