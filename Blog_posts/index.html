As far as user experience Google has a in my opinion has done a fantastic job with their user experience, they make it so easy to navigate within their website and make their search query very fast and simple to use. With the design that Google has applied to their website, it is very simplistic and that’s not a bad thing! It makes it very user friendly, you never catch yourself getting distracted with clutter on the website and that makes for a very enjoyable experience.

YouTube is a great website if your looking for a quick distraction or even looking for a “how to video”, their user experience is very nice there is never a shortage of things to watch and YouTube does a fantastic job with keeping everything for the most part very easy to use, although their website at times does come off very cluttered due to all the uploads. Which brings me to YouTube’s design; they have done a fantastic job with giving you options right away to view. I think that’s a very nice feature for someone who has never been to their site they instantly know what it is all about.

Last but not least we have iHeart radio, I know there are many online music streaming websites out there but for the most part iHeart Radio is very user friendly, and simplistic. iHeart radio is great for anyone who is just looking to hear some good music from a favorite artist or maybe a old song that they just remember last night, I especially like how they build a entire playlist based on your selection. The design of iHeart radio website is also fantastic, they have a large search bar which makes it very easy to find what your looking for, and the catchy red theme they have is very eye pleasing as well.
