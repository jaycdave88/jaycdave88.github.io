		<p>When I think of times in my life where I have been the happiest, proudest or most satisfied, the following values come to mind:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Health</li>
		<li>Self-knowledge</li>
		<li>Confidence</li>
		<li>Accountability</li>
		<li>Challenge</li>
		<li>Community</li>
		<li>Confidence</li>
		<li>Cooperation </li>
		<li>Courage</li>
		<li>Creativity</li>
		<li>Personal development</li>
		<li>Physical challenge</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Personal growth is very important value to me. I never want to feel that I am not being challenge; I have always tried to make sure that never happens. Rather it is in personal or professional areas of my life. I enjoy the really hard challenges that some other people might walk away from, I love them because I know that at the end I will have learned and grown just a bit more.</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Health -> 5</li>
		<li>Self-knowledge -> 5</li>
		<li>Confidence -> 5</li>
		<li>Accountability -> 4</li>
		<li>Challenge -> 5</li>
		<li>Community -> 5</li>
		<li>Confidence -> 5</li>
		<li>Cooperation -> 4 </li>
		<li>Courage -> 5</li>
		<li>Creativity -> 5</li>
		<li>Personal development -> 5</li>
		<li>Physical challenge -> 5</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The last person who asked me for advice, was a good buddy of mine and he was asking me about how to get a business going and how do I reach my demographic of customers. He is a great hard working guy, and I told him that and reassured him that nothing worth having comes easy. I also helped him make his company website, and helped him make a road map of what he wants to accomplish, I am his kind of accountably buddy, I check in with him once a week and we talk about his business and what he needs to do and what has he done since the last time we spoke.</p>

		<p>How do I feel when I think of my values? Do I think if can help me mediate stereotype threat if I recognize I feel it? I feel that my values will help me through any stereotype threat that might present itself later in my life. I also think my hard work ethic and my relentless pursuit for personal growth will keep me level headed.</p>

		<p>I am very into working out, although I would say I haven&#39;t been able to do so much of it since I have been moving around so much and with DBC. If I ever feel that I need some thing to cheer me up, Ill just head to the gym for a bit and get a quick workout in and sweat out what ever frustrations I have. </p>
