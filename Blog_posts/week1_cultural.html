First off I would just like to say that video really helped me by letting me know that my same concerns, other people have them as well. I think DBC and the culture and experience they offer is something completely fresh and such a great idea, not only are they teaching you how to program and potentially get a career (I only say potentially, because if someone finds out that programming is not their “cup of tea”.) but they are also emerging you within the development community, which in my opinion is something that many companies or lack.

I did a lot of homework, in which kind of boot camp I wanted to get involved with. After everything was all said and done I had to choose between hacker reactor and DBC, and I am so happy that I chose DBC and that DBC chose me. When I was having my Skype interview with Greg V. I was so nervous that I was going to mess up and right away from the first time we talked, he just had a kind of laid-back nature and very empathic approach. The only reason why I mentioned Greg is to me he was the face of DBC, and from what he offered I was very impressed with DBC as a whole.

With the culture that I have seen so far, all I can say is “I am home”, the feeling of belonging and knowing that “OMG, there other people like me?!” is just mind blowing, I am still trying to wrap my head around it!

My expectations have changed; from when looking online for different school to starting phase 0, to working on my first HTML and CSS project. Everything has changed, I now know that I need to work even harder to reach my goal, and DBC showed me that with the positive culture that they represent. My expectations have been risen, not so much for DBC but for myself to be a fellow team member or student or what ever, I now know that people out there have the same worries that I have and that I can always ask them if I have any questions, especially knowing that this isn’t the horrible traditional schooling environment. I am extremely excited, and happy to be a part of this already amazing program, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous, but I am nervous in a good way!

I just wanted to rant a little bit more, in regards to the culture. I am very happy that DBC knows and acknowledges the importance of.. Its not just school, it’s a culture your learning to be a part of.
