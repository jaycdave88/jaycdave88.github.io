				<p>A Problem that is facing the tech world is the same issue that it has faced from the rise of the digital information age...The technology does not always work.</p>
				<br>

			<p>When we wake up and get out or bed and sometimes before we even get out of bed, some of us pull out our phones and check what ever it is that we check that day. Its okay we all do it.</p>
			<br>

			<p>When some of us wake up and get out of bed the first thing we do before we even get out of bed is check out phones! Myself included, but why do we do that? Is it because we just want to know what&#39;s going on in our social media words? Or is it that we have become so depended on our technology and how everything is at our fingertips? Lets just say (and I hope this does not happen to anyone!) your phone didn&#39;t work or your laptop or tablet! What would we do?</p>
			<br>

			<p>The biggest issue with technology is that it has the real issue of not working or failing. If we take a second to think of all the systems that are run by technology and how if something were to happen what would the consequences be. This is what happened to American Airlines recently when they were ground all flights.</p>
			<br>

			<p>We as a society have become depended on technology to the point that if something was to happen that most if not all of our systems would be crippled. The question I always ask myself is how do we get around this, what are some ways to solve the issue of our dependence on technology. Some solutions that I found to this would be of course try to limit our interaction with technology.  For some of us, that may not be a issue but for most of us its going to be a lot harder. What if we found a way to make our technology more secure and dependable so that we don&#39;t always have to worry about.</p>
