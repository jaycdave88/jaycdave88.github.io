	<h3><a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></h3>
			<p>Is a video sharing service that allows users to watch videos posted by other users and upload videos of their own. YouTube is solving the issue of how to connect people via videos let it be from funny cat videos to how to do it tutorials, YouTube has it all. YouTube has in my opinion a very grand visual challenge, their site is very cluttered, it has everyones videos. </p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.iheart.com">iHeart Radio</a></h3>
			<p>Is an Internet radio platform, where anyone can listen to local streaming music and also provides users of the site with additional access to different music from favorite musicians to songs or genres. iHeart Radio, is providing a service to whom ever visits their site, for streaming music with minimal commercials. iHeart Radio, has a bit of visual challenge of being too cluttered as well. Although I will give it credit for not being as cluttered as YouTube.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></h3>
			<p>Is a search engine that provides information about (someone or something) on the Internet. Google, is a very popular search engine that allows users to search for just about anything, providing quick information on topics and search queries. I dont believe that Google has any visual challenges, the site is very simple not too cluttered and very quick and responsive.</p>
