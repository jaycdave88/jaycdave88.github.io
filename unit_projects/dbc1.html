	<h3><b>Alittle about myself!!</b></h3>
	<br>
	
	<i>Jay C. Dave`</i>
		<p>I recently moved here from Chicago! In search of a new career and too meet some amazing people along the way! I have lived in the East coast, I had to leave that didn't fit my vibe! California is a lot better! I think it has to do with all the sun out here, haha. Everyone is just in a better mood.</p>

		<p>A little bit about my family, I have one older sister who is a project manager for Fishnet Security, and my brother in law works at Though works as a Senior Consultant about to make Lead Consultant. My mother and father who are both in Chicago have been happily married for 29 years, my mother owns and operates a hair salon, as well as some other ventures that Ill tell you on a separate time :). My father is Vice President for Excell Electronics, as well as part owner in a RPT Toner company, with some shares in some grocery stores and liquor stores. As you can tell I have a lot of family support in technology industries.</p>

		<p>I moved to California this year, at the beginning of this year. I had a world trip that too me to some very poverty stricken areas. Instead of choosing to go to Mexico or Cabo I chose to go to India, Thailand, Singapour,and Japan. All I can say is its a big world out there, Sometimes I forget how lucky all us are who have the ability to just turn on a light switch or turn on the tap and know that fresh drinking water or the lights will come on. Seeing how people lived and was an eye opening experience, but you know something... I saw a group of kids playing cricket in the slums just smiling and having a good time, these kids had nothing to our Western standers, but had the biggest smiles ear to ear! I had to find out why... I went down and played some games with them and that made my trip all worth it, to see little kids smile just to meet you.</p>
